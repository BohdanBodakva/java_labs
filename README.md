# Lab5-6


Stones. Determine the hierarchy of precious and semiprecious stones. Select stones for necklaces. Search for stones in the necklace that match the specified range of transparency parameters.
Implement the ability to sort found products:
- By total weight (in carats)
- At cost
- The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order


Task description
- You need to create a class - Manager that will contain logic (example for option 1):
- Realize the search for goods that can be bought for a girl in the autumn period and realize the possibility of sorting the found goods:
  1. at a price
  2. by size
- The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order



- Use the built-in sorting methods available in Java to sort
- Sorting should be implemented in a separate method
- The code does not contain static methods / attributes. Only one static method is allowed - void
- Code must use enum type (if necessary)




Convert the project with code 2-3 so that its assembly can be used with maven.
At the same time it is necessary to make the command of merging of previous works in master
Important: Build the project with the mvn clean package console command

You can generate pom.xml using the maven command (console research):

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=ua.lviv.iot -DartifactId=work -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.0 -DinteractiveMode=false

It is necessary to write modular tests for the code of laboratory previous tasks and to reach a level of coverage by tests of 80%. Obviously, the ideal 
coverage is 100% (ie each line of code is covered by tests). It is also obvious that writing tests takes a considerable amount of time, which is always lacking. One way 
to avoid this problem is the TDD approach. For this laboratory compromise value will be coverage by tests at the level of 80%


For the implemented class hierarchy in the 3rd laboratory, the list of objects present in the managers should be recorded in the CSV file

pubic String getHeaders () {â€¦} - returns a string of attributes present in this class, separated by commas
pubic String toCSV () {...} - returns the value of the attributes (field values) of this object, separated by commas


To implement a file entry, you must implement a separate Writer class (for example, CrocodileWriter), which will contain the public void writeToFile (List <Crocodile> crocodiles) method. The challenge of this method should be implemented from the tests
The code must match the code convention

Also, you should add checkstyle and spotbugs plugins to pom.xml and test the code with these parsers
You should also fix any errors that spotbugs will find and reduce the number of errors that checkstyle points out.
To check the quality of the code, run the mvn clean site command
