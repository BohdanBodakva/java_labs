# Lab2 
Stones. Determine the hierarchy of precious and semiprecious stones. Select stones for necklaces. Search for stones in the necklace that match the specified range of transparency parameters.
Implement the ability to sort found products:
- By total weight (in carats)
- At cost

The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order


Classes need to be properly divided into packages.
Working with the console or console menu should be kept to a minimum.
Important: only the class hierarchy needs to be implemented, the search code for items in lists or collections is not included in lab2
You should also create objects of the classes you have implemented in a separate Main class, which will contain the main method
